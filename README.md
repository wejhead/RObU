Resonant Objects in Unity 


Implementation of real-time modal synthesis algorithms as 
proposed by (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kvdoel/publications/thesis.pdf, among others)
in Unity. 


In this repo you'll find a unity project with the implementations 
as well as a set of tools for creating modal models. 

[very much a work in progress]
